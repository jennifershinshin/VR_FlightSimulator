# Flight Simulator

*WARNING: May cause nausea*

This was one of our labs for my Virtual Reality class! We had to build a flight simulator to give us a better understanding of yaw, pitch, and roll in VR.

You may shoot the spheres in the air to make them disappear. The spheres will reappear after 5 seconds after shot.

For the purpose of playing the game without a VR headset, I modified the game to be playable on the keyboard and mouse.
